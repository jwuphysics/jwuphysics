### ‚ú® Hello! ‚ú®

My name is John, and I study how galaxies form and grow by using telescope observations üî≠ and machine learning üñ•Ô∏è techniques. Although I enjoy learning about galaxies, both near and far, I've recently become very fascinated by dwarf galaxies. I also like to stay up to date on deep learning research, particularly computer vision ü§ñ. Here's some of the recent stuff I've been up to:

- [Holwerda et al. 2021, ApJL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03377) We used machine learning to predict the spectrum of Rubin's Galaxy, an unusually large and tranquil nearby galaxy, purely from imaging, and discovered that its super-massive black hole should be actively accreting! See below for the method.
- [Wu & Peek 2020, NeurIPS/ML4PS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12318) Presents a convolutional neural network with hybrid deconvolution and batch normalization for estimating galaxy spectra from image cutouts. Check out the [code](https://github.com/jwuphysics/predicting-spectra-from-images/)!
- [Wu 2020, ApJ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.00018) A thorough investigation of how nearby galaxies' neutral hydrogen gas content depends on their appearances---again, through morphology learned by neural nets---and also their environments.
